## About

This is a website created by *[Guanyu Zhang](https://github.com/TonyZhang2004)*, for collaboration with He Li and Taiye Chen, in Kaggle's American Sign Language competition held by Google.

***NOTE***: Keep checking **Discussion** on the website for newly-asked questions by other competitors.

## Collection of some useful references with brief intro

### **[Getting Started with Kaggle workflow](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)**

A competition for those who are new to Kaggle, predicting the survivors on Titanic, just press the "join competition" and follow the instructions to submit a prediction in ".csv" format.

### **[TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)**

The model to be submitted should be a **TensorFlow Lite** model.

### **[Keras](https://keras.io/)**

APIs for DL with TensorFlow.

### **[Parquet File Format](https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-the-parquet-file-format-13adb0206705)**

1. The data in this competition is stored with **".parquet"** format, which is well-known for **efficient storage** and **fast read speed**.
2. ***".parquet"*** is 50x faster than ***".csv"*** when using ***pd.read_csv()***.

### **[MediaPipe Holistic Model](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/docs/solutions/holistic.md)**

The source of data, could be useful for feature engineering and data preprocessing.


### **[A baseline using LSTM for ASL](https://www.kaggle.com/code/stanptown/lstm-baseline-for-starters-sign-language-eeff0f)**

Using **Long Short-Term Memory** for this competition, could modify this for improvements.

### **[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/)**

A **gradient-boosting** library which implements lots of ML algorithms.

### **[LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**

A **gradient-boosting** library which implements lots of ML algorithms.
